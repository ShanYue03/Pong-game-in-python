üéÆ # Pong Game
A classic Pong game built using Python's turtle library. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, game logic, and collision detection.

üõ†Ô∏è ## Features
- Two-Player Mode: Play with a friend using the keyboard controls.

- Left Paddle: W (up) and S (down).

- Right Paddle: Up Arrow (up) and Down Arrow (down).

- Ball Physics: Realistic ball movement with bounce logic for walls and paddles.

- Score Tracking: Keeps track of each player's score and updates the scoreboard dynamically.

- Dynamic Speed: The ball's speed increases as the game progresses, adding to the challenge.

üîß ## How It Works
1. Paddles: Two paddles are controlled by players to hit the ball.

2. Ball Movement: The ball moves continuously and bounces off walls and paddles.

3. Collision Detection:

 - Detects collisions with the top/bottom walls to bounce vertically.

 - Detects collisions with paddles to bounce horizontally.

4. Scoring:

If the ball passes the left or right boundary, the opposing player scores a point.

The ball resets to the center after a point is scored.

üß∞ ## Technologies Used
- Python

- turtle module for graphics and animations.

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modular and reusable code.
